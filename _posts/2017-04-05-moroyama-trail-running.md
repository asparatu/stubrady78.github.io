Last Sunday, I went trail running in Moroyama with a group of Namban runners. I was looking forward to the trip as I’d enjoyed my first experience on the trails in Ome back in November, and I’m happy to say the day didn’t disappoint! In lovely spring weather, we managed to complete about 20 km around the Kamakita lake area. My highlights were the Totoro-esque waterfall we found in the forest (unfortunately I forgot to take a picture) and a leg-burning climb on one of the forest roads towards the end of the run, which made a pleasant change from Kawagoe’s flatness. After we took a shower at a local public gymnasium (only 100 yen), we caught the train back to Kawagoe for a pasta and pizza lunch. We then had a walk around the old part of Kawagoe (it was fun being the tour guide), before going our separate ways home.

I'm keen to do more trail running around here in the future. Moroyama seems to be a popular area for both runners and cyclists, and it's only a short train or car journey from my house. What’s more, if I can’t get out there for a run any time soon, I’m definitely going to take my family there during Golden Week: I can show them the waterfall (and maybe sit in it) and then we can all take a ride on one of the swan boats in the lake.

I’ve included my Strava data for the trip below. We started and ended at the gymnasium. They were happy for people to leave their stuff in the changing area, although you need to complete a form with your details before you leave the site. It cost about 1100 yen by taxi from there to Nagase-Bushu station (around 4 km away).
