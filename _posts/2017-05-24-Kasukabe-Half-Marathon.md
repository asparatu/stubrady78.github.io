description: A half at the home of Crayon Shin-chan

On May 4, I completed the Kasukabe Half Marathon in 1:33:33. This was 
a little faster than my first half in February, but someway off my "dream goal" of 
breaking 1:30. On reflection, 1:30 was pretty unrealistic as my fitness 
levels weren't up to it. I also struggled in the heat (around 25 degrees) and my 
pacing throughout the race was pretty bad. I did manage to stay around 1:30 pace for the 
first 10K, but once I got to half-way, I knew I was toast. I then ran in a funk/daze 
for another 9K, before pride kicked in and I was able to finish reasonably strong.

Other than the "medium" result, I enjoyed my day out. The marshalling was great, and 
I felt I had everything I needed (though no towel in the goodie bag at the end). My 
wife and daughter also said they enjoyed the ents and food stands at the start/finish area. The only negative was 
that we had to park the car a good 25 minutes walk away from the venue, which meant for a pretty tough walk on the way back. Also, runners need to 
be aware that there is a railway crossing about 3K into the race, though I 
got lucky and didn't have to wait.

Looking ahead, my next race will be a half in Cornwall, England, over the summer 
holidays. I'm looking forward to it as it's near where I grew up and it will be pretty 
cool having my mum and my dad and my gran cheering on. After that, I'm going to start training for 
the Saitama International Marathon in November, which, right now, is a scary thought indeed!

Thanks for reading:)
