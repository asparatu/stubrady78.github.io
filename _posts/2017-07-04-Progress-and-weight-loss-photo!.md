description: I'm definitely getting better!
---

It's been a while since my last post. TBH I've been a little lazy (and a little busy) and 
sometimes it's tough to sit down and write something now I feel I've "done" my website. 

So, what's been going on? Well, it seems that my running has come on pretty well in the last 
10 months and I have some evidence to prove it:) The other day I was time travelling 
through the Namban forums looking at the 5K Time Trial reports and I noticed these 
are my results:
<ul style="list-style-type:none; font-family:Space Mono, sans-serif">
<li>September 28th, 2016 - 23:05</li>
<li>November 30th, 2016 - 21:19</li>
<li>January 25th, 2017 - 20:36</li>
<li>February 22nd, 2017 - 20:12</li>
<li>March 26th, 2017 - 19:36</li>
<li>May 31st, 2017 - 19:23</li>
<li>June 29th, 2017 (Tokyo City TT) - 19:27</li>
</ul>
Obviously, I've made a fairly sizeable improvement (from admittedly a low base). So 
how did it happen? First my training is getting more consistent with each passing month. 
I now log about 80k a week and check all the boxes with the different types of running - 
speed work, tempo stuff, ez and long runs and such like. I've also improved my pacing, 
which has meant I'm running a little smarter now. 

However, the biggest factor has probably been the weight loss. Only the other day I was 
watching some video of daughter's sports day last October and the change is pretty 
massive. I weigh about 75 kilos now, so I've lost a good 20 kilos through diet and 
exercise:) So I guess, as with all these things, it's time to unleash the embarrassing 
photographic evidence. Enjoy.

I suppose I need to think about what's next as I go into year two of my improvement. 
Regards the 5k, I'd like to go sub 19 by the end of the summer. Can I do it? I'm 
not sure. Will I try? Absolutely!

Thanks for reading:)
