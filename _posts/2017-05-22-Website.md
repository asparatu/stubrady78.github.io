description: The rebuild is over!
---

I promised myself I'd get my website rebuilt by the end of Golden Week. I didn't
make it, but I'm happy to say that I've finally finished. Although the build is a 
lot simpler than before, it's functional and a lot more of it is my own work. I now also feel 
a lot more confident about using HTML, CSS, jQuery and Bootstrap. There are still 
a few kooky things to be worked out and bits I'd like to improve (converting the 
CSS to Sass being a priority); however, there's nothing critical to work on, so 
I can start to focus again on content.

Looking forward, I'd like to learn a little more about Ruby and Ruby on Rails. I've 
started taking a few courses through <a href="https://www.codeschool.com/">Codeschool</a>. 
As always, the courses are fun, but I don't won't to fall into the trap again of watching 
endless screencasts. I need to find something to make something (an app or whatever) 
that forces me to apply what I've learned, otherwise I'll just forget everything 
I've learned.
