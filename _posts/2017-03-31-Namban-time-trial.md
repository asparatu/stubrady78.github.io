On Wednesday night, I did the Namban 5K time trial in Yoyogi Koen and my plan was to try and break 20 minutes for the first time. Unfortunately, I overran the finish (by over 400 metres!), so I had to piece my time together from my phone app data and Strava. My best guesstimate was 19:36, which I mainly worked out from Strava’s beta Flyby feature.

Overall, I’m pleased with the result as I’m running about a minute faster than eight weeks ago. It also gives me more confidence that I can go under 1:30 at the Kasukabe half-marathon during Golden Week.

From April, we can use the track at <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/d/viewer?ll=35.668453909359805%2C139.69749170108025&spn=0.006842%2C0.012274&t=h&msa=0&z=16&ie=UTF8&iwloc=00049b084c98c58307b18&mid=1INfD-I5itQfjMN8Amzm1iBmhksk">Oda field</a> again, so I’m interested to see how fast I can go with another month’s training and under more optimal conditions. Yoyogi koen gets fairly gloomy at night and dodging other runners, dog walkers and random drunks make the running harder. I will miss the gentle downhill section, though!
