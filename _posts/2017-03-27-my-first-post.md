Hello world! Recently I have been trying to learn a little about
computing and front-end web development, which got me wondering if I could
build and maintain my own website. Well, this is it. The site is hosted on
Github (something else I'm trying to learn about), built with Bootstrap and
powered by Jekyll. I also used the "Clean Blog" template on startbootstrap.com
to help me get started. I chose this setup because I thought it looked easier
(and a lot more secure) than making something with Wordpress.

For the blog, I wanted somewhere I could write about my running as I've become
more serious (obsessive?) about it in the last year. In November 2016 I ran my first
marathon. I followed this with a half-marathon in February and I plan to do two more by the summer, so I thought this would be a good place to record my thoughts
about my training.

Anyway, I don't imagine many people will read this site, but it's going to be fun
trying to improve it whilst writing a little bit about my life as I go.
