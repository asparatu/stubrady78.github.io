description: I'm definitely getting better
---

It's been a while since my last post. TBH I've been a little lazy as tough to 
sit down and write something now that I'm "done" building my website. 

So what's been going on then? Well, it seems my running has come on pretty well in the last 
10 months and I have evidence to prove it:) While I was time traveling through the 
Namban forums the other day, I took a look at the 5k time trial reports and I noticed 
these are my results:
<ul style="list-style-type:none; font-family:Space Mono, sans-serif">
<li>September 28th, 2016 - 23:05</li>
<li>November 30th, 2016 - 21:19</li>
<li>January 25th, 2017 - 20:36</li>
<li>February 22nd, 2017 - 20:12</li>
<li>March 26th, 2017 - 19:36</li>
<li>May 31st, 2017 - 19:23</li>
<li>June 29th, 2017 (Tokyo City TT) - 19:27</li>
</ul>
As you can see, I've made a pretty decent improvement - from what was admittedly 
a pretty low base. This got me thinking about how it happened. First, I think my 
training has become more structured in the last 12 months. I now log about 80k a week and my 
runs check all the different boxes - plenty of ez, tempo stuff, some speed work, a long 
run, etc. I've also improved my 5k specific pacing aswell, which means I'm now racing 
a little smarter over the distance.

However, the biggest factor has been my weight loss. 
Only the other day I was watching a video of me at my daughter's sports day last October and the 
change is fairly startling. I'm weigh around 75 kilos now, so I've probably lost a 
good 20 kilos through diet and exercise! Obviously, I'm chufffed and I owe a 
lot of that success to the power of running. I guess the only thing to do 
now is unleash the (highly embarrassing) photographic evidence.

Thanks for reading. Oh, running is ace! (I pinched that very true sentiment 
from someone on Strava - thanks.)
