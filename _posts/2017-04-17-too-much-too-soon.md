Well, things didn't go as planned this week. I was starting to feel rundown by Tuesday and the doubles were making me miserable! Fortunately, there was a rainstorm on Tuesday evening, so I skipped my run and by the following day I was feeling somewhat better. I then decided to ditch the 60 mile a week goal. With hindsight, I realise I didn't rest enough on my cut back week. It was actually more like 'race week', as I was desperate to run a sub 20 minute 5k at the time trial and I also wanted to keep my end up on the trail run in Moroyama. I was then able to get through the following week on muscle memory, before crashing back down to earth. I guess I've reached my limit for this training cycle and it's time to back off. Going forward, I'll do what I can at the beginning of this week and then aim to do a 'comfortably hard' longish effort this Friday. I hope this is a more workable (and enjoyable) plan.

<h2>On coding</h2>

I've been thinking a lot about this blog recently. In fact, I'd like to tear the site down and start again (though I intend keep the content I've already written). To be honest, I'd like to rely less on templates/plugins and start writing more of my own code. I've spent a lot of time picking my way through the site's HTML, CSS and javascript this week, and there's plenty I'm capable of doing myself. I just need to take up the challenge and build, build, build! It would probably be a good idea to start recording my progress with that on here, too.

Happy running:)
