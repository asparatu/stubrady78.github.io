For the last month, I have been increasing my mileage in preparation for the Kasukabe
half-marathon on May 4th. My aim has been to up the distance to 60 miles (97 km) a week, whilst
still fitting in a couple of quality workouts. You can see my results in the Strava graphic
below:

Although the training has been a little draining at times, I do feel I’ve gotten fitter. This week I plan to cut back the mileage and then use the first three weeks of
April for sharpening, before tapering for the race. One thing to add, though,
is that I’ve started to feel some tendonitis around my left knee. This is not the first time
I’ve had this, so I know how to stretch/strengthen the area, but it’s a good reminder that
I need to be more consistent with my prehab in the future. Simply, it could mean the
difference between making progress in my running or having to take an enforced break because I’m injured!
