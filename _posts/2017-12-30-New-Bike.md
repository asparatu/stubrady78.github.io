description: First ride to the mountains
---

So last week I bought myself a second hand racing bike. I've wanted one for a while and I was lucky enough to pick this one up for a reasonable price from a friend. It's quite old but it's in decent condition and, as far as I can tell, does everything I'll need it for.

Basically, I wanted the bike so I can start exploring Chichibu. It's such a great area that is close to my house but it's a little far to run to and I'm usually too lazy to get on the train!

I've been out for a few rides but my favorite so far was to Ogose this Wednesday. My plan was to take Route 299 to Chichibu City and then hang a right at some point into Moroyama/Ogose. Everything went pretty much according to plan and I got to enjoy a nice climb up a mountain (I forget the name) and then a pretty ride through Ogose itself. I was also chuffed that I could take the cycle path pretty much all the way from Ogose to Kawagoe on the way home, which meant I avoided a lot of the scary traffic.

It's been really good to realize a bit of a dream of mine and actually make the biking thing happen. I'm now thinking about what next. Short term, I'd like to do a similar ride again. Maybe I'll go the other way and then head right once I get to the top of that pass. I'm guessing this will eventually take me to Tokigawa Town. It would be also cool if I could ride over 100km on the next big ride too. And what else? Well, I'm definitely keen to ride to Mt. Fuji and back before the summer. It looks pretty doable and it would be nice to make 2018 the year I finally climb the most famous mountain in Japan!
