In a previous post, I mentioned I was getting some pain on the outside of my left knee. I'm happy to say it appears to be getting better! I think it's improved because I've started following again a pilates for runners video I found on YouTube a few months ago. I've probably done the routine around 20 times and my hamstrings and knees always feel a little better after. Parts of the routine are a little tough (Crisscross being the hardest for me), but the routine is fairly short (about 20 minutes), clearly narrated and always leaves me in a good mood when I'm done. Please check it out if you're interested.
