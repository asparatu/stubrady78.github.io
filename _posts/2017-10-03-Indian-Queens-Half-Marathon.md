description: Running first race in Cornwall and getting injured
---

Again, I haven't updated this site in ages as I've been busy 
learning Javascript, particularly how to make retro games using Phaser. 
All good but I do get the odd twinge that I dumped my website. Anyway, I'm here 
to see if sheâ€™ll take me back.

In the summer, I went back to the UK to visit family in Cornwall. One of my goals 
for when I was back was to run a race and I'm happy to report that I completed the 
Indian Queens Half Marathon successfully. My time was 1:34:31 (good for 86th out of 555). 
It wasn't a spectacular time (I've definitely got more that!) but I was pleased 
considering I'd pulled a muscle in my calf three weeks previously. I also enjoyed 
running in front of my family (who gave me excellent support) and to spend some time 
around the Cornish running community (all be it very briefly). Everyone was really friendly and I'm keen to try 
another race next time I'm back in the UK. 

Regarding the nuts and bolts of the course, it was pretty tough. There were a lot of 
undulating hills and the pot holes on the dirt tracks in the nature reserve were a 
killer! I guess I'm pampered where I train in Saitama, right? 

In the aftermath of the race, I was a bit of a mess. My leg swelled pretty bad (though 
I did give it plenty of ice for 24 hours) and it was painful to walk for a few days. The 
following Friday, I went to a physio in Saltash and she diagnosed a grade 1+ calf strain.

I did the rehab for a few weeks but I came back too soon and I'm injured again;( It's my 
own fault as I really wanted to do the Saitama marathon on November 12th and I didn't 
want to miss my training (or get fat!), Anyway, I've now ditched that goal and I'm 
off running until it heals properly. With luck I'll be back for the Koedo Half Marathon 
at the end November,

Wow, that's the post done. A lot quicker and easier than I thought!
