![Running too much]({{ stubrady78.github.io }}/img/Screenshot from 2017-04-25 14-45-19.png)

I took things way easier last week. I had a few convenient excuses (some rain - yes, I am weak - and my wife's birthday on Sunday being two) and, in the end, I only managed a couple of easy 10Ks and my Friday long run. The rest has really helped, though I do worry a bit about what kind of shape I'm going to be in for Kasukabe during Golden Week. We shall see.

Yesterday I had a private swimming lesson with one of the triathletes at Namban (he's also a registered ironman coach). It was my first time to take a private class, but as I've been wanting to start swimming again for a while now (particularly as my four-year-old daughter is enjoying her swimming classes so much) I thought why not give it a go! The coaching was very helpful. He pointed out three weaknesses in my freestyle stroke and then we worked on some drills to fix them. Overall, I found the coaching relaxed but purposeful and the rates for a one hour lesson were satisfactory. I'll probably go back in a couple of weeks after I've had a chance to practice on my own. You can find more details <a href="http://tri-kcoaching.wixsite.com/tri-k">here</a> if you're interested.

The coding has been coming on well this week. I've been revisiting jQuery (it finally seems to be clicking) and I've also started the rebuild of my website, which I plan to roll out after Golden Week. My next goal is to finally start making some HTML5 games with the <a href="https://phaser.io/">phaser</a> library. Maybe I'll start next week!

Happy running:)
