![Increased mileage]({{ stubrady78.github.io }}/img/running-log-one.png)
I surprised myself by running every day this week. I also ran 65 miles - a personal record! To be honest, I felt pretty tired at the beginning of the week as I was still recovering from last Sunday’s trail running, but by my long run on Friday I was feeling back to my usual self, and I was able to run a good chunk of the course at a brisk pace.

Looking ahead, I plan to maintain my current mileage for the next two weeks, before winding down to my race on May 4th. Sadly, my school holidays have finished, so I don’t have as much free time for running during the day. To overcome this, I thought I might experiment with running some doubles a few times a week. For my quality work, I am going to include some time at threshold/race pace in my Friday long runs, though this is easier said than done as I’m still not convinced that I know what that pace is yet!

Happy running:)
