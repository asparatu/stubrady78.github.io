description: Completing my local half marathon
---

Hello again! On November 26 I completed the Koedo (Kawagoe) Half Marathon. I finished in 2:02:38, which was okay considering I hadn't been able to a lot of run a lot with my calf injury. I basically treated it like a training run and I felt pretty good by the time I got to the finish:)

I had a fun day out. I was lucky enough to run with a friend of mine for the first few kilometers before he headed off up the field. I then got to enjoy the enthusiastic support of the crowd (including lots of tasty free snacks) and the camaraderie of the other entrants - a little chat here and there was really cool. It was a also pretty nice to run through areas that were familiar to me for a change and the old part of the city looked great as always.

After the race we went back to my wife's parent's house for some lunch and a nap. We then went to <a href="http://www.saiboku.co.jp/kachofugetsu">Saiboku onsen</a> for a bath and some food. As usual, the onsen was beautiful and the food was great too. I had the tonkatsu (deep fried breaded pork) meal set. It's a bit of a speciality as the people that own the onsen also have a farm and have won quite a few awards for their German sausages and stuff.
